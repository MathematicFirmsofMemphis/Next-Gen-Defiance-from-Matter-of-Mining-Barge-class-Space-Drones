# Next-Gen-Defiance-of-Matter-from-Mining-Barge-class-Space-Drones
Similar to operations from Dune but for pyrotechnic materials across any universe near 50000-D with 3-D distance. Mostly on desert planets we see with machine vision
This version uses 1:1 not cos(1:400). Where 1 is 20000 metric pounds to 20000 metric pounds of pyrotechnic propulsion mentioning the gaming pc parts and cargo hold earlier on this line as part of 1 away from pyrotechnics.
The pyrotechnics would need a spark plug and be reuseable. 
The Motherboard manages the pyrotechnics 
The basic understanding is that metal and carbon fiber replaces wood in 20,000 pounds with all parts and second is adding the pyrotechnics based on fireworks weight to ratios
